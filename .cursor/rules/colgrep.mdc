# ColGREP Semantic Search

When the user asks to **find code by describing what it does** (e.g. "where do we handle authentication?", "function that retries failed requests", "code that validates email addresses"), use the **colgrep search** MCP tool instead of grep.

**Use colgrep search for:**
- Natural language queries ("where do we...", "how do we...", "function that...")
- Finding code by behavior or intent
- Discovering implementations without knowing exact names
- Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, logging, validation)

**Use grep for:**
- Exact string matches
- Regex patterns the user provides literally
- When the user says "search for the text X" with an exact quote

ColGREP understands meaning and finds semantically similar code. Grep only matches text.
