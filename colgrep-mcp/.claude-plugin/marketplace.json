  "description": "Semantic code search powered by ColBERT. Find code by describing what it does, not just matching keywords.",
  "longDescription": "ColGREP uses AI (ColBERT multi-vector embeddings) to understand the meaning of your queries and find relevant code even when exact keywords don't match. It's much more powerful than grep or symbol search, supporting 45+ programming languages with automatic incremental indexing.",
